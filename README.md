This repository contains examples and questions on for loops in Java. A for loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a counter or condition. It is typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, making it ideal for tasks like iterating over arrays, processing collections, or executing a fixed number of steps.
